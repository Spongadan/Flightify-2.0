# Expanding Team Flightify: Predictable VFR Air Traffic Forecasting in All Major Airports in the US
Aircraft using VFR usually are not required to file a flight plan and are not automatically monitored by air traffic control. More resources are required to manage their flights which can cause a safety risk when airports are caught unprepared by a large influx of VFR traffic. Therefore, Team Flightify 2.0 will expand the work of the Summer 2021 Team Flightify to improve the accuracy of VFR flight predictions in class G airspace, which will enable the FAA to assess risk and allocate proper resources. The partner will be able to integrate the predictions into the ArcGIS (GLARE) platform.
